          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
          <p>
            My father grew up in a small fishing village off the coast of Shanghai. The year my father graduated from middle school, Mao Zedong announced that the country would embark on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution" target="_blank">Cultural Revolution</a> to cleanse itself of bourgeois elements that had allegedly infiltrated society. Step one was to shut down all high schools and cease administering the college entrance exam. Step two was to send all of those high school- and college-age youth who would otherwise be pursuing higher education to work in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_to_the_Countryside_Movement" target="_blank">rural</a> farms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ten years later, after the government came to its senses, my father had the opportunity to sit for the college entrance exam. He had three months to learn four years’ worth of geometry, advanced algebra, pre-calculus, chemistry, physics, biology, Chinese literature, and history, and he only had one chance to do it, because he would be over the age cutoff by the next administration of the exam. He borrowed textbooks from anyone he could find and pored over the materials like his future children depended on it.

          </p>
          <p>
            He was the only one in his village who passed the exam that year. This set off the chain of events that eventually led to my father coming to the United States to get his PhD in molecular cell biology, being one of the early scientists working on the Human Genome Project, and then getting hired as a Research Professor at UCSF. This set the stage for my brother to graduate from Harvard Law School, for myself to graduate from Berkeley Law, and for my sister to pursue an electrical engineering degree at UCSD.
          </p>

            I heard stories from my father’s childhood all the time growing up. One of the things I learned was that life is not a meritocracy. Hard work, skill, and talent are important, but so much depends on luck and timing. What if my father had been born a year earlier? What happened to my father’s classmates who could not cram an entire high school’s worth of curriculum in three months, but would, nonetheless, have been outstanding academics, had they not had a ten-year detour to farm life after middle school? Historians call those youths who were cut off from higher education during the Cultural Revolution the “Lost Generation.” They were lost because they were born at a time when higher education should have been available to them, but for the short-sighted actions of a leader who wanted to eliminate the political threat of a well-educated populace.

            This isn't all that dissimilar to entrepreneurship today. It's not a <a href="http://www.wired.com/2013/11/silicon-valley-isnt-a-meritocracy-and-the-cult-of-the-entrepreneur-holds-people-back/" target="_blank">meritocracy</a>. We live in an age when it's easier than ever to start a business. But the competition's fierce. Innovative ideas often lie in legal grey areas.

             Those who can afford it hire a lawyer. Those who can't, tend to act as de facto general counsel of their companies until they can. With any luck, they won't:
             <ul>
               <li>
                 Lose their house/retirement savings/kids' college fund due to not forming/correctly maintaining a limited liability entity while pursuing a risky venture;
               </li>
               <li>
                 Make their company worthless by forgetting to have everyone who worked on <b>any</b> IP related to the company a Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement;
               </li>
               <li>
                 Unwittingly assign IP to their existing employer by developing IP "during work breaks" or using employer-provided resources;
               </li>
               <li>
                 Be forced to rebrand their entire company identity after failing to run a trademark search before using someone else's name in commerce;
               </li>
               <li>
                 ...and a billion other things.
               </li>
             </ul>
           </p>

             We live in too awesome of a time for this to be the state of society. I'm working on making things better.
