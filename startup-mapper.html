          <h2>What is this?</h2>
          <p>
            Above is a map of all of the investment round listings on Crunchbase as of December, 2015, categorized by US county. Some background: Crunchbase is an online platform that crowdsources investment data on companies -- think Wikipedia for startups, except all submissions undergo moderator review before being posted.
            <sup id="fnref:1.crunchbase">
              <a href="#fn:1.crunchbase" rel="footnote">1</a>
            </sup>
            Basically, if a company receives institutional investment, it's going to get listed on Crunchbase.

          <p>
            This map contains an overlay of all law schools in the 50 states.
            <sup id="fnref:1.puertorico">

            </sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            There are a few takeaways we can glean from this map:
            <ol>
              <li>Law schools seem to be located in the same counties that have at least some Crunchbase activity;</li>
              <li>Where law schools are sparse, they tend to straddle the borders of multiple states; and</li>
              <li>California
                <sup id="fnref:1.correspondence">
                  <a href="#fn:1.correspondence" rel="footnote">3</a>
                </sup> and New York have a LOT of law schools.
                <sup id="fnref:1.lawschools">
                  <a href="#fn:1.lawschools" rel="footnote">4</a>
                </sup>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <h2>But wait!</h2>
          <p>
            Isn't this more of a map showing Crunchbase's market penetration, rather than business activity?
            <br><br>Maybe. Let's see what the map would look like if, instead, we used data from the US
            Census Bureau...
          </p>
          <h1>Using Census Bureau Data on Small Businesses</h1>
          <iframe sandbox="allow-scripts allow-forms allow-same-origin" src="/cbp_map_with_law_schools.html" width="960" height="600" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
          <p class="captions">Sources: County Business Patterns from the <a href="http://www.census.gov/econ/cbp/" target="_blank">US Census Bureau</a>, <a href="http://eric.clst.org/Stuff/USGeoJSON" target="_blank">Eric Celeste's GeoJSON Data (US Counties)</a>, and, of course, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_law_schools_in_the_United_States" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
          <p>
            Look familiar? I filtered the County Business Patterns dataset from the US Census Bureau for small businesses -- defined as companies with 500 or fewer employees. Unfortunately, I couldn't find data for certain counties in the dataset for some reason. If you find a more complete dataset, please let me know. I'd love to fill in those missing counties.

            <br><br>However, the overall picture is pretty clear: <strong> law schools tend to be in places with high levels of business activity.</strong> Not too surprising, I know. But high levels of business activity tend to be in cities, rather than rural areas, and law students tend to want to stick around where they went to school.

            <br><br>As a result, we're facing a massive justice gap
            <sup id="fnref:1.blawquote">
              <a href="#fn:1.blawquote" rel="footnote">5</a>
            </sup> in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp/2014/08/25/how-do-you-keep-them-down-on-the-farm-once-theyve-passed-the-bar/" target="_blank">rural areas</a> and we've got to figure out ways to address it. Some states have created programs to incentivize lawyers with  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/09/us/subsidy-seen-as-a-way-to-fill-a-need-for-rural-lawyers.html" target="_blank">cold, hard, cash</a>. With the current price of law school tuition, I'm all for that. But there's still more we can do at the law school level to increase legal access in a sustainable way.

            <br><br>Why can't rural populations access lawyers? It's not just that lawyers are far away -- we've got phones, email, and Skype for that. It's the money. And I'm not saying that lawyers are greedy, blood-sucking parasites for charging what they do. It's a free market and it takes many years of hard work to gain the expertise to effectively counsel clients.

            <br><br>So what's the alternative? <strong>We have plenty of law students hungry for experiential learning opportunities at law schools that are, by and large, concentrated in urban areas.</strong> Law school clinics -- particularly ones that have a strong economic development<sup id="fnref:1.economicdevelopment">

              <a href="#fn:1.disclosure" rel="footnote">7</a>
            </sup> can help address the needs of rural populations. When it comes to entrepreneurship, this can be especially powerful, as clients who successfully navigate the many obstacles of startup law tend to wind up in a position where they can afford a lawyer. And an accountant. And office space, employees, giving back to the community, etc.
